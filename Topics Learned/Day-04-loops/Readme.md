# 🐍 Day 4 – Loops in Python

---

## 📌 Introduction

Day 4 focuses on understanding loops in Python.

Loops allow programs to execute repetitive tasks automatically without rewriting the same code multiple times. This is essential for handling large datasets and performing structured analysis.

---

## 🎯 Objective

The goal of Day 4 is to:

- Understand `for` loops
- Understand `while` loops
- Automate repetitive tasks
- Apply loops in data-based scenarios
- Combine loops with conditional logic

---

## 🧠 Why Loops Matter in Data Analytics

In real-world data analysis, loops are used to:

- Iterate through rows of data
- Calculate totals and averages
- Classify transactions
- Validate datasets
- Process large collections of records

Automation improves efficiency and reduces manual effort.

## 🔎 Concepts Covered

- `for` loop
- `range()` function
- Iterating through lists
- Accumulating totals
- Combining loops with `if` statements
- `while` loop
- Loop control using counters

---

## 🧪 Script Summary

The script demonstrates:

- Printing sequences using `for` loop
- Calculating total sales from a list
- Classifying profit vs loss transactions
- Using a `while` loop with a counter

---

## 💡 Key Learning

Loops transform static code into dynamic automation.

Understanding loops builds the foundation for:

- Data processing
- Large-scale analysis
- Automation workflows
- Advanced data manipulation using Pandas

Strong loop fundamentals make analytical coding efficient and scalable.
