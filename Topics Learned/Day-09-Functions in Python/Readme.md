# 🐍 Day 9 – Functions in Python

---

## 📌 Introduction

Day 9 focuses on understanding functions in Python.

Functions allow us to write reusable blocks of code, improving efficiency and organization.

---

## 🎯 Objective

The goal of Day 9 is to:

- Define functions using `def`
- Pass parameters to functions
- Return values using `return`
- Reuse functions in different scenarios
- Apply functions in business-based logic

---

## 🧠 Why Functions Matter in Data Analytics

Functions are essential for:

- Automating calculations
- Creating reusable analytical logic
- Structuring data processing workflows
- Improving code clarity
- Reducing repetition and errors

Functions make code scalable and maintainable.

---

## 🔎 Concepts Covered

- Function definition
- Parameters
- Return statements
- Calling functions
- Reusing logic inside loops

---

## 🧪 Script Summary

The script demonstrates:

- Creating a greeting function
- Calculating profit using a function
- Classifying customers into tiers
- Reusing the classification function for multiple revenue values

---

## 💡 Key Learning

Functions transform basic scripts into structured programs.

Understanding functions is critical before moving into:

- Lambda functions
- Data manipulation libraries
- Advanced analytical workflows

Strong structure leads to strong analysis.
