# 🐍 Day 15 – Working with CSV Files in Python

## 📌 Introduction
Day 15 focuses on working with CSV files in Python.

CSV (Comma-Separated Values) is one of the most commonly used file formats in data analytics.  
Understanding how to handle CSV files is a major step toward working with real-world datasets.

---

## 🎯 Objective
The goal of Day 15 is to:

- Create CSV files using Python  
- Read structured data from CSV files  
- Process rows one by one  
- Convert data types (string to numeric)  
- Perform basic business calculations  
- Append new records to existing CSV files  

---

## 🧠 Why CSV Handling Matters in Data Analytics

In real-world analytics workflows:

- Sales data is exported in CSV format  
- Customer databases are shared as CSV  
- Financial transactions are stored in CSV  
- Reports are downloaded as CSV  
- Data pipelines often begin with CSV files  

Before using Pandas, it is important to understand how structured data is stored and processed at a basic level.

CSV handling bridges the gap between basic file handling and advanced data manipulation.

## 🔎 Concepts Covered

- `import csv` module  
- `csv.writer()`  
- `csv.reader()`  
- Writing headers and rows  
- Reading structured data  
- Looping through dataset rows  
- Type conversion using `int()` and `float()`  
- Basic revenue calculation logic  
- Appending new data  

---

## 🧪 Script Summary

The script demonstrates:

- Creating a structured sales dataset in CSV format  
- Reading and displaying header information  
- Calculating revenue per order  
- Computing total revenue  
- Appending a new order to the dataset  

This simulates a real-world sales processing workflow.

## 💡 Key Learning

Working with CSV files enables interaction with structured datasets.

Understanding CSV operations prepares the foundation for:

- Data cleaning  
- Data transformation  
- Aggregation logic  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Transitioning into Pandas DataFrames  

Real data analysis begins with reading structured data files.

Strong data handling skills build strong analytics foundations.
