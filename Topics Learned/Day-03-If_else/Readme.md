# Day 3 – Conditional Statements (If / Else) in Python

---

## 📌 Introduction

Day 3 focuses on understanding conditional logic in Python using `if`, `elif`, and `else`.

Conditional statements allow programs to make decisions based on specific conditions.  
This concept is fundamental in programming and plays a major role in data analytics workflows.

---

## 🎯 Objective

The goal of Day 3 is to:

- Learn how decision-making works in Python
- Apply business logic using conditional statements
- Understand comparison and logical operators
- Build structured analytical thinking

---

## 🧠 Why Conditional Logic Matters in Data Analytics

Conditional logic is used in real-world analysis to:

- Classify customers into value tiers
- Identify profitable vs loss-making transactions
- Detect risk patterns
- Apply validation rules
- Segment data based on performance

Data becomes actionable when we apply structured decision logic.

## 🔎 Concepts Covered

- Basic `if` statement
- `if–else` structure
- `if–elif–else` ladder
- Logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`)
- Comparison operators (`>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `==`, `!=`)

---

## 🧪 Practice Script Summary

The Python script demonstrates:

- Sales performance evaluation
- Profitability check
- Customer revenue segmentation
- Low-value order detection

The script applies multiple conditions to simulate real business scenarios.

## 💡 Key Learning

Programming is structured decision-making.

Conditional logic builds the foundation for:
- Data classification
- Automation of business rules
- Analytical segmentation

Strong fundamentals in logic improve problem-solving ability.
