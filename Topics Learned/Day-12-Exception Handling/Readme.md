# 🐍 Day 12 – Exception Handling in Python

---

## 📌 Introduction

Day 12 focuses on exception handling in Python.

Exception handling allows programs to manage errors gracefully instead of crashing during execution.

---

## 🎯 Objective

The goal of Day 12 is to:

- Understand `try` and `except`
- Handle common runtime errors
- Use `else` and `finally`
- Write safer and more stable code

---

## 🧠 Why Exception Handling Matters in Data Analytics

In real-world data analysis:

- Datasets may contain missing values
- Inputs may be incorrect
- Calculations may cause division errors
- Unexpected runtime issues may occur

Exception handling prevents crashes and ensures smooth execution.

---

## 🔎 Concepts Covered

- try
- except
- Multiple exception handling
- else block
- finally block
- Generic exception handling

---

## 🧪 Script Summary

The script demonstrates:

- Handling division by zero
- Managing invalid user input
- Using else and finally blocks
- Calculating average profit with error protection

---

## 💡 Key Learning

Professional code anticipates errors.

Exception handling improves:

- Program stability
- Reliability
- User experience
- Analytical workflow safety

Writing safe code is a sign of mature programming.
