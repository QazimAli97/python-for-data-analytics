# 🐍 Day 8 – Tuples in Python

---

## 📌 Introduction

Day 8 focuses on understanding tuples in Python.

Tuples are ordered collections of elements that cannot be modified after creation.  
They are useful for storing fixed or constant data.

---

## 🎯 Objective

The goal of Day 8 is to:

- Create tuples
- Access elements using indexing
- Understand immutability
- Use tuple unpacking
- Iterate through tuple values

---

## 🧠 Why Tuples Matter in Data Analytics

Tuples are commonly used to:

- Store fixed transaction records
- Represent constant configurations
- Return multiple values from functions
- Ensure data integrity

Immutability prevents accidental data modification.

---

## 🔎 Concepts Covered

- Tuple creation
- Indexing
- Looping through tuples
- Tuple unpacking
- Understanding immutability

---

## 🧪 Script Summary

The script demonstrates:

- Creating a transaction record using a tuple
- Accessing tuple elements
- Looping through values
- Unpacking values into variables

---

## 💡 Key Learning

Tuples provide data integrity through immutability.

Understanding tuples strengthens knowledge of structured data handling before moving to advanced concepts like functions and data manipulation libraries.
