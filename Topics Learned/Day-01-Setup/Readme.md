# Day 1 – Python Installation & Development Environment Setup

---

## 📌 Introduction
This repository documents my structured Python learning journey for Data Analytics. 

Day 1 focuses on setting up a clean, professional Python development environment. Before building analytical solutions, it is essential to ensure that the system is properly configured and ready for structured development.

**This marks the official beginning of my Python journey.**

---

## 🎯 Objective
The goal of Day 1 is to:
* Install Python correctly and configure the system **PATH**.
* Set up a professional code editor (**VS Code**).
* Install **Jupyter Notebook** for interactive analysis.
* Verify the environment using a test script.
* Establish a clean project structure for future scaling.

A strong foundation prevents technical errors later when working with advanced libraries like Pandas and NumPy.

## 🛠 Tools Installed & Configured

### 1️⃣ Python (Latest Stable Version)
- **Source:** [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- **Configuration:** Installed with “Add Python to PATH” enabled.
- **Verification:** Verified via terminal using `python --version`.

### 2️⃣ Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
Installed as the primary IDE for:
- Writing structured scripts and managing project folders.
- **Extensions:** Installed the Microsoft Python Extension for linting, IntelliSense, and debugging.

### 3️⃣ Jupyter Notebook
Installed for interactive data exploration and visualization.
- **Command:** `pip install notebook`
- **Use Case:** Step-by-step analysis and experimentation.

## 🧪 First Python Script
I created a verification script to ensure the interpreter and IDE are communicating correctly.

**File:** `day1_setup.py`
```python
# Day 1 – Python Setup
# Author: Mohammad Ali
# Purpose: Verify Python installation and environment readiness

print("Hello Python!")
print("Environment setup successful.")
print("Python is ready for Data Analytics learning 🚀")
```

# 🧠 Why Proper Setup Matters

Many beginners ignore environment setup and later face:

- PATH errors  
- Package installation issues  
- Version conflicts  
- Execution failures  

A properly configured environment ensures:

- Smooth library installation  
- Stable project development  
- Professional coding habits  
- Clean and reproducible workflows  
- Interview-ready development practices  

Strong foundations make advanced topics easier.
