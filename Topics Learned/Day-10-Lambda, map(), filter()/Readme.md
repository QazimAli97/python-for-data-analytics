# 🐍 Day 10 – Lambda Functions, map() & filter()

---

## 📌 Introduction

Day 10 focuses on understanding lambda functions and the use of `map()` and `filter()` in Python.

Lambda functions are small anonymous functions used for short operations, especially useful when working with lists and datasets.

---

## 🎯 Objective

The goal of Day 10 is to:

- Understand lambda function syntax
- Apply `map()` for data transformation
- Apply `filter()` for data filtering
- Write concise and efficient code
- Use functional programming techniques

---

## 🧠 Why This Matters in Data Analytics

Lambda functions combined with `map()` and `filter()` are useful for:

- Applying transformations to datasets
- Filtering records based on business rules
- Cleaning data
- Performing quick calculations
- Improving code efficiency

These tools are often used in preprocessing and automation workflows.
