# 🐍 Day 14 – File Handling in Python

---

## 📌 Introduction

Day 14 focuses on understanding file handling in Python.

File handling allows programs to read and write data from external files. This is a critical step toward working with real-world datasets.

---

## 🎯 Objective

The goal of Day 14 is to:

- Open files using Python
- Read file contents
- Write data to files
- Append new information
- Use safe file handling methods

---

## 🧠 Why File Handling Matters in Data Analytics

In real-world analytics workflows:

- Data is stored in files (CSV, TXT, etc.)
- Reports need to be saved externally
- Logs are maintained
- Output results must be exported

File handling is the foundation before moving into data libraries like Pandas.

---

## 🔎 Concepts Covered

- open() function
- File modes: 'r', 'w', 'a'
- read() method
- write() method
- Using `with` statement for safe execution

---

## 🧪 Script Summary

The script demonstrates:

- Writing a sales report to a file
- Reading the file content
- Appending additional information
